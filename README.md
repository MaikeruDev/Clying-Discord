## Features

### How to Play

1. **Initiating the Game**: Start a new game by using the command `/creategame`.
2. **Receiving the Images**: Once the game begins, all players, except for the liar, will receive a random image.
3. **Discussion Phase**: Players take turns describing the image they received. The liar has to pay close attention and come up with a believable description of an image they haven't seen.
4. **Voting Phase**: After the discussion, players vote on who they believe is the liar. The player with the most votes is revealed.
5. **Revelation**: The true identity of the liar is revealed, and points are awarded based on the voting results. 

Remember, the key to winning is to be convincing, whether you are telling the truth or weaving a tale of deception!
